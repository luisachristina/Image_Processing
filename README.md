# Image_Processing
This project aims to develop an automated pipeline for satellite image processing, focusing on generating land use and land cover masks. Utilizing high-resolution images from the CBERS 04A satellite and vector data from Open Buildings V3, the process involves segmenting the images into smaller patches, followed by georeferencing to align building data. The resulting masks distinguish between built-up and non-built-up areas, providing valuable insights for urban analysis, territorial planning, and monitoring changes in land use over time. The project combines geoprocessing techniques and machine learning to create a robust dataset, essential for environmental and urban studies.
